        introduction: `Listening to music has become synonymus with humans in the past decade, people no longer listen to 
                        music exclusively in concerts and festivals. Most of the music listening happens while relaxing at home, in the gym, while studying,
                        during work hours, while commuting and so on. Due to this, music needs to be easier to discover and share amongst peers
                        and music lovers. I decided to take a journey in designing an application that provides music lovers with a platform where they can
                        easily discover, listen to and share music from their favourite artists with others. Walk with me....

        problem: `The typical music sharing process involves a user discovering new music from their preferred music streaming platform, listening to the music and later
                    sharing the music they have listened to. This usually takes a lot of time as these three processes usually happen in two or more applications.
                    They discover and/or listen to music in app A and share the music with people in their contacts in app B.
                    Because music discovery happens in different applications it is usually hard to keep track of what music one has listened to and what they have shared.

                    I sought out people who listen to music and love sharing the music they listen to in order for me to understand what they want and how their typical experience looks like.
                    With the help of five music lovers I conducted in person Q&A sessions/fun interviews :)/ to determine what typical users think of music sharing. Through these interviews
                    I mapped my mind around what users feel and this proved to be an inmportant part of the UX design process, It provided insights into what users want and what they expect from
                    a music sharing experience.`,

                    Throughout this project I emphasize on the user's overall experience while buying products from an 
                    online store. From organizing information for easy retrieval to making a friendly navigation that only has essential 
                    items, I greatly reduced the cognitive load a user has. Throughout this project I have emphasized on three main aspects

                        the customers behave, organize information and how they search for hair products in the store. Using this information 
                        I designed a website for their online store.`,

                    Not having a clear cataloguing structure for hair products, visual clutter, users getting lost while going through products and a

                    to correctly map their needs to the website and still manage to ensure the brand gets what it needs from the website, I unearthed a big
                    amount of user needs that needed to be fixed in the design. I used these user stories and journey maps to inform my design decisions.`,
